.SYNOPSIS 
     Starts an Azure Automation runbook job and either returns the job id or waits for the job
     to complete and returns the job output

.DESCRIPTION
    This runbook starts a child runbook when called from a parent runbook.

    Requirements:
       1. Azure Org Id credential asset in the Automation account of this runbook 
          (see http://aka.ms/runbookauthor/authentication for information)

.PARAMETER ChildRunbookName
    The name of the runbook to start.

.PARAMETER ChildRunbookInputParams
    A hashtable whose keys are names of parameters for the child runbook, with corresponding values.

.PARAMETER AzureOrgIdCredential
    A credential containing an Org Id username / password with access to this Azure subscription.
	If invoking this runbook inline from within another runbook, pass a PSCredential for this parameter.
	If starting this runbook using Start-AzureAutomationRunbook, or via the Azure portal UI, pass as a 
    string the name of an Azure Automation PSCredential asset instead. Azure Automation will automatically 
    grab the asset with	that name and pass it into the runbook.
    
.PARAMETER AzureSubscriptionName
    The name of the Azure subscription to connect to.

.PARAMETER AutomationAccountName
    The name of the Azure Automation account that the runbook to start exists in.

.PARAMETER WaitForJobCompletion
    Boolean value.  If true, wait for the runbook job to finish.  If false, don't wait
    and return the job id.  Default is false.

.PARAMETER ReturnJobOutput
    Boolean value.  If true, the runbook job output is returned as a string.  Both this parameter
    and WaitForJobCompletion must be true to get job output.  Default is false.

.PARAMETER JobPollingIntervalInSeconds
    An integer that sets the time in seconds to wait between each poll of the child job to 
    determine if the job has finished.  Default is 10 seconds.  This is used only when 
    WaitForJobCompletion is true.

.PARAMETER JobPollingTimeoutInSeconds
    An integer that sets the maximum time in seconds to poll the child job.  
    If this time limit is exceeded, a timeout exception will be thrown.
    Default is 600 seconds (10 minutes).  This is used only when WaitForJobCompletion is true.

.EXAMPLE
    Start-AutomationChildRunbook `
        -ChildRunbookName "Update-VM" `
        -ChildRunbookInputParams @{'VMName'='VM204';'Retries'=3} `
        -AzureOrgIdCredential $cred
        -AzureSubscriptionName "Visual Studio Ultimate with MSDN"
        -AutomationAccountName "Contoso IT Automation Production" `
        -WaitForJobCompletion $true `
        -ReturnJobOutput $true `
        -JobPollingIntervalInSeconds 20 `
        -JobPollingTimeoutInSeconds 120
